Small guide for people who don't know how to run Python scripts.

1. install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.6 and above)
2. install pip (option in the Python installer)
3. install the python module UnityPy (open a console (e.g. cmd) and enter ``pip install UnityPy==1.7.39``)
4. run update.py (downloads all missing or outdated assets and unpacs them)
